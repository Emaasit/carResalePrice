##Prediction of the Resale Price of Cars

Data collected from **Kelly Blue Book** for several hundred 2005 used **General Motors (GM)** cars allows the development a multivariate regression model to determine car values based on a variety of characteristics such as mileage, make, model, engine size, interior style, and cruise control.

I have developed a shiny app that creates a multivariate linear regression model 
using the caret's cars data set. This model can be used predict the resale price of a car 
based a variety of characteristics. Accompanying the shiny app is an Rstudio presentation that explains this project.
