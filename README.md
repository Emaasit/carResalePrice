##Effectiveness of Insect Sprays

A **completely randomized experiment** was conducted to evaluate the effects of different insect sprays on insect prevalence in agricultural plots.  

Agricultural plots were assigned completely at random to receive six different insect spray treatments, the first of which is the control.  There are 72 plots in the experiments.  Each spray was assigned to 12 plots and the control to 12 plots.  The response variable consists of the counts of insects in the agricultural experimental units (plots) treated with the different insecticides.
