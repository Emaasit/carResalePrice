##Effectiveness of Insect Sprays

A **completely randomized experiment** was conducted to evaluate the effects of different insect sprays on insect prevalence in agricultural plots.  

Agricultural plots were assigned completely at random to receive **six different insect spray treatments**, the first of which is the control.  There are 72 plots in the experiments.  The response variable consists of **the counts of insects** in the agricultural experimental units (plots) treated with the different insecticides including spray **A, B, C, D , E and F**.

I have a developed a shiny app that can be used to predict the number of insects in the agricultural plots by the different types of sprays. Accompanying the shiny app is a slidify presentation that explains the project.
